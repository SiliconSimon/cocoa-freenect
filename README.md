## Prerequisites

You use this you need to install other things first. Here is a really nice and simple way to get started using the super power called [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)!

Right, do these things:

1. Install Homebrew using the instructions found [here](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/)
2. In a terminal do this `brew update`
3. Then do this `brew install libfreenect`

You should now have a shiny new libfreenect (OpenKinect) install!

If you want you can test the installation by plugging in your Kinect, turning on the mains power and running `glview` in the terminal.
